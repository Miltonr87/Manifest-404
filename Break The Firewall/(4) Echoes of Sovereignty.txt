[Verse]
Palm trees sway but the roots decay
Cities hum with a restless ache
History’s screaming but no one hears
Echoes of sovereignty drowned in fear

[Prechorus]
Flags burn but the colors fade
Hands reach but they won’t get paid

[Chorus]
Don’t call the American Superman
He won’t save this promised land
Echoes of sovereignty in the sand
Don’t call the American Superman

[Verse 2]
Iron chains in a gilded frame
Gold mines worked by another name
The soil bleeds but the crops won’t grow
The sky cries for what we don’t know

[Prechorus]
Dreams sold for a dollar’s grace
Lies etched in a foreign face

[Chorus]
Don’t call the American Superman
He won’t save this promised land
Echoes of sovereignty in the sand
Don’t call the American Superman
