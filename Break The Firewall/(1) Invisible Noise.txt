[Verse]
Walls closing in again
No space no air no friends
Screaming faces in my head
Feel alive but feel so dead

[Chorus]
Alone in the crowd alone again
Voices crash but none of them mend
Alone in the crowd alone again
Broken hearts don't ever blend
Broken hearts don't ever blend

[Verse 2]
Streetlights flicker like a joke
Every step's another choke
Echoes bounce off concrete walls
My shadow's all that ever calls

[Prechorus]
I run I stop
I scream I drop
But no one looks no one talks

[Chorus]
Alone in the crowd alone again
No space no air no friends
Screaming faces in my head
Feel alive but feel so dead

[Prechorus]
I run I stop
I scream I drop
But no one looks no one talks

[Chorus]
Alone in the crowd alone again
Lost in the noise where does it end
Alone in the crowd alone again
I can't break what I can't defend
Alone in the crowd alone again
I can't break what I can't defend

[Bridge]
Pavement burns under my feet
Silent war no retreat
Graffiti screams but it's no use
This city's grip just cuts me loose

[Chorus]
Alone in the crowd alone again
Voices crash but none of them mend
Alone in the crowd alone again
Broken hearts don't ever blend

[Chorus]
Alone in the crowd alone again
Voices crash but none of them mend
Alone in the crowd alone again
Broken hearts don't ever blend

[Verse 2]
Streetlights flicker like a joke
Every step's another choke
Echoes bounce off concrete walls
My shadow's all that ever calls

[Prechorus]
I run I stop
I scream I drop
But no one looks no one talks
[Prechorus]
I run I stop
I scream I drop
But no one looks no one talks
[Prechorus]
I run I stop
I scream I drop
But no one looks no one talks
[Prechorus]
I run I stop
I scream I drop
But no one looks no one talks
