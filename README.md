# ðŸ“€ Manifest 404 (Break the Firewall)

Punk has always been about tearing down walls. Not just the ones built by governments or corporations, but the invisible ones that keep us apart â€” firewalls of fear, silence, and disconnection.

**Invisible Noise** opens the record with the chaos of loneliness, that feeling of screaming into static while nobody answers back. Itâ€™s the sound of being lost in the crowd, swallowed by the metropolitan cityâ€™s.

From there, **Code Revolution** sparks the rebellion. The riffs hit sharper, the lyrics turn outward â€” itâ€™s not just about being trapped inside your head anymore, itâ€™s about smashing the systems that profit from your silence armed with code, a computer, and a cup of coffee.

Then comes **Pixelated Love**, where irony cuts deep. A love song filtered through screens and glitches, it turns the digital world into a broken mirror. Affection reduced to pixels, intimacy trapped behind firewalls.

The album darkens with **Echoes of Sovereignty**, a heavy anthem of fractured freedom. Itâ€™s the sound of identity stripped bare, asking if sovereignty even exists in a world ruled by the USA â€” masked as Superman â€” flies above the world with its algorithms and surveillance.

Finally, the title track â€” **Break the Firewall** â€” delivers the blow. Itâ€™s defiance and catharsis all at once: the crash of guitars breaking chains, the chant of voices tearing down every barrier. The moment the album turns from despair into action.

This isnâ€™t just five songs. Itâ€™s a journey:  
**Isolation â†’ Revolt â†’ Irony â†’ Identity â†’ Liberation.**

_Break the Firewall_ is more than an album title. Itâ€™s the call to smash every boundary â€” digital, political, emotional â€” until nothing stands between us and each other.
